							<p>This is the first module of the MSc Computer Science at the University of Essex Online. The goal of this module is to provide the fundamental theories and practices of computing</p>
							<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
								<ol>
									<li>Identify and explain the architecture, structure and functionality of basic components of computer system</li>
									<li>Demonstrate a critical understanding of core data structures and programming concepts, including algorithm computability</li>
									<li>Critically evaluate the functionality of different types of software, i.e., operating system, utility programs, languages and applications.</li>
									<li>Critically appraise the emerging trends in the field, such as cloud computing, big data, cyber security, and the professional and ethical requirements for dealing with such contemporary computer-based technologies.</li>
								</ol>
							
							<h2>Artefacts Created</h2>
								<h3>Unit 1-3 Discussion Forum - Initial post</h3>
									<p>In 2015, Facebook’s Code of Conduct was a short, simple, legal document focusing on employees’ obligations toward Facebook. 
									The protection of user data was a single clause with a single paragraph (Facebook, 2015). In 2021, the Code of Conduct changed into a long, 
									presentation-looking document emphasizing employees’ commitment to the company and its users. 
									Five pages cover respecting people’s privacy and responsible innovation. Some responsible innovation dimensions are Constructive discourse, 
									Well-being, and Privacy and data protection (Facebook, 2021).<br>

									Facebook’s, and now Meta’s, new Code of Conduct is meant for the general public. It looks appealing, puts the users and the community at the front, 
									and uses buzzwords such as positive impact, embracing diversity, being kind, transparency, and sustainability (Facebook, 2021; Meta, 2022).<br>

									There is, however, a gap between Facebook/Meta’s words and actions. The company was fined for several GDPR violations, which it plans to appeal. 
									For example, in 2021, WhatsApp was fined 225 million euros for failing to inform how it shares users’ data with Facebook (Collins, 2022). 
									In 2022 Instagram was fined 402 million Euros for not adequately protecting children’s data (Satariano, 2022). 
									Documents leaked in 2021 by a former employee revealed that the company was aware of the harms it causes, be it a negative influence on 
									teen girls' mental health, promotion of misinformation, or hate speeches (Lima, 2021; McEvoy, 2021).<br>

									Including the company’s users in its Code of Conduct was a good first step. However, saying the right things is meaningless if there is no behavioral change. 
									Meta, for example, should actually be kind by improving its oversight over misleading or hateful content and how they promote it. 
									Technology is rapidly evolving, and government regulation takes time. Self-governance and transparency should help improve public precipitation.</p>
